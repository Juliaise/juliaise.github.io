# Julia Install Guide

This is not really an installation guide. It's a set of steps and
links to helpful information on those steps. 

## Background

These days Julia comes as a stand-alone package which has a build-in
installation of Python, which is used for some tasks. You can use your
own version of Python, but that complicates life, so best to start
with the default.

Julia, by iself, is fully functional, but most people find it easier
to interact with it through an IDE (like Rstudio). the one of choice
these days is VS Code.

Finally, to get full utility with Julia, you'll need to install some
extra packages. This is really easy, but it's helpful to have a list of
go-to packages to start with.
